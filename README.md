### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 
<P> My name is Derek. I am a sales professional with ten years in the beverage industry focused on brand management and wholesale distribution. I am currently enrolled in MITxPro full-stack development program. I am learning front-end development working with JavaScript. Soon, I will be learning back-end development working with Mongo DB, Express, React, and Node. 

 Focused on programming full time, my passion for building brands and executing sales strategies will allow me to work with businesses on Omni and Multi-channel levels.
